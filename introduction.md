Hi, this is Shuhuai Cao, a student at Penn State University.

IGN is a well-known media among us video game players. In my country, China, it is also one of the most popular game media. Local game media usually reports IGN’s opinions about the game when a new game is released. I usually visit IGN to check the latest news and read reviews about the games and movies I’m interested in. I will refer to the reviews when I hesitate about whether to buy a game.

I became interested in programming when I was young. It is amazing to see the code I wrote running and I dreamed of becoming a programmer in the future.

Another dream of mine is to join a company related to games like game development or game media. I think games can bring happiness to players and it is really cool to collaborate with people who love games. People always think I’m a shy person, but I will become talkative and fanatical when talking about things I’m interested in.

My major is computer science, and I will graduate by the end of this year; thus, I am eager to bring what I have learned into practice. Therefore, I think Code Foo is an opportunity for me to improve my programming skills and contribute to real-world projects.
