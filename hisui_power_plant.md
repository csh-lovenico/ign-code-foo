Since the data provided are insufficient to calculate the accurate number, I will analyze what data are needed to help me calculate how many Voltorbs can fully power a village.

The first thing I need to know is how much power Jubilife Village uses. The data may be able to obtain from the old power plant in this place.

The second thing is how much power a Voltorb can produce. Well, I’m not familiar with Pokémon so I assume that there is a machine that can test how much power a Voltorb can produce.

If the Pokémon world still conforms to the law of conservation of energy, Voltorbs will get tired after producing too much power. Therefore, the time a Voltorb can produce power continuously until it gets tired and the time it takes to recover should also be considered.

The minimum number of Voltorbs required to light up the village is the power the village use divided by the power one Voltorb can produce.
